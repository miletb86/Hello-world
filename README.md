In Sprint #1


I successfully applied the structure of test cases and utilized functional scenarios to identify real bugs within the application, contributing to product quality through clear and precise bug documentation. Throughout the sprint, I demonstrated a strong understanding of test case design and effectively leveraged scenarios to detect relevant issues. I took initiative by identifying unexpected behaviors and documenting them accurately, resulting in the successful reporting of 10 valid bugs. Additionally, I enhanced the quality of bug reports by following the recommended structure for bug titles—clearly stating what happens, where, and when—to facilitate easier reproduction by the development team. This experience helped me strengthen my skills in regression analysis, visual validation, and effective communication of incidents, providing valuable learnings for future sprints.
